# Empire Troop Generator
### “I'm a man of simple tastes. I'm always satisfied with the best.” ― Oscar Wilde

## The Problem
Every player in Empire has a castle. To let players attack another player’s castle, we need to create armies of randomly distributed troops (a troop is a formation of soldiers with the same skill, such as Spearmen, Swordsmen, Archers, etc.)
This is the project to generate the troop randomly.

## Project Set Up
1. Go into the directory where the project now lives - `cd GoodGames`
2. Install the dependencies - `npm install`
3. Start the app - `npm start`

## Test
1. Please add some of Troops.
2. Input total number of army.
3. Click the "Generate Troops" button. Then you can see the Troops generated randomly.
